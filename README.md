#### Gameplay:
The player, controlling a Tank, must destroy enemy tanks in each level, which enter the playfield from the top of the screen. The enemy tanks attempt to destroy the player's base (represented on the map as a bird, eagle, or Phoenix), as well as the human tank itself. A level is completed when the player destroys all enemy tanks, but the game ends if the player's base is destroyed or the player loses all available lives. Note that the player tank's weapon can destroy the base as well, so the player can still lose even after all enemy tanks are destroyed.
#### There are several types of treasures:
- Tank: gives an extra life.
- Star: it improves player's tank.
- Bomb:  destroys all visible enemy tanks.
- Clock: freezes all enemy tanks for a period of time.
- Shovel: adds steel walls around the Phoenix for a period of time.
- Shield: makes player's tank invulnerable to attack for a period of time.
